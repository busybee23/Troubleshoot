I was getting this error while starting my jupyter notebook : "Timed out waiting to get a heartbeat from kernel process"

Solution I used : My interpreter were mismatching, I've installed anaconda and python both environment and my interpreter settings in Visual studio code were messed up
so I made a clean and quick tut for sovling the issue.
